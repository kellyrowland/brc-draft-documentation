#### Some potential questions that need answering:

Some questions that we might be asked, that might help us suss out what sub-pages will initially be required:

* What is cloud computing support?
* What cloud platforms are covered? (Initially AWS-focused, but plan to support platforms pertinent to campus researchers. Likely will include Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, XSEDE, and NERSC.)
* When will cloud computing support become available?
* What does it cost? (Free of charge.)
* How do I request support? (Write to to-be-set-up cloud support email address.)
* How much help can I request?
* How long will it take before I'm contacted?
* What's not covered by support? (These points come from Area 1 in the cloud proposal.)
  * Consulting to develop, debug, or extensively tune performance of computational software.
  * Providing help desk support for operational aspects of cloud computing services. (We'll likely need to clarify this further ...)
  * Integrating local campus infrastructure directly with public cloud resources.
* I know about / am interested in the cloud. How can I work with you, as a consultant or campus partner?

* Should I use the cloud or my departmental or group computing cluster?
* Should I use the cloud or the campus's Savio cluster?
* Which cloud platform is most suitable for my needs? (I.e. in advance of or in lieu of consulting, what are some of the major characteristics of each platform that might help me narrow down my investigation?)
* How do I get started with cloud platform _x_?
* How can I apply for a vendor grant (or provider allocation, etc.) to use cloud platform _x_?
* How do I pay for my use of cloud platform _x_?
