### Cloud Computing Support


#### Pages we might need / questions that need answering:

* What is cloud computing support?
* What cloud platforms are covered? (Initially AWS-focused, but plan to support platforms pertinent to campus researchers. Likely will include Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, XSEDE, and NERSC.)
* When will cloud computing support become available?
* What does it cost? (Free of charge.)
* How do I request support? (Write to to-be-set-up cloud support email address.)
* How much help can I request?
* How long will it take before I'm contacted?
* What's not covered by support? (These points come from Area 1 in the cloud proposal.)
  * Consulting to develop, debug, or extensively tune performance of computational software.
  * Providing help desk support for operational aspects of cloud computing services. (We'll likely need to clarify this further ...)
  * Integrating local campus infrastructure directly with public cloud resources.
* I know about / am interested in the cloud. How can I work with you, as a consultant or campus partner?

* Which cloud platform is most suitable for my needs? (I.e. in advance of or in lieu of consulting, what are some of the major characteristics of each platform that might help me narrow down my investigation?)
* How do I get started with cloud platform _x_?
* How can I apply for a vendor grant (or provider allocation, etc.) to use cloud platform _x_?
* How do I pay for my use of cloud platform _x_?

#### From the one-pager ...

##### Engage with researchers to match requirements with appropriate cloud resources

* Review computing and data requirements for research uses to identify where those uses translate well to cloud resources.
* Assist researchers in identifying the set of cloud services that efficiently and effectively address their computational and storage requirements.
* Simplify the use of commonly used software stacks across multiple cloud platforms.
* Provide documentation, training, guidance, and referrals for translating commonly-encountered computing requirements into patterns suited for efficient and cost-effective use of cloud resources for instruction and research.
* Help researchers working with sensitive data identify whether and how they can appropriately work with that data on cloud resources.

##### Facilitate access to cloud resources

* Assist researchers in obtaining provider grants.
* Provide support for incorporating cloud computing resource costs into funding proposals.
* Publish documentation and provide consulting to help researchers benefit from campus contracts and guidelines.
* Assist researchers to manage costs and/or transfer times for moving data to and from cloud resources.

##### Automate cloud provisioning

* Provide automated provisioning scripts, ‘best practices’ examples, documentation, and consulting to support integrations with cloud providers that address specific types of campus research and instruction.
* Allow PIs to conveniently manage, and delegate the management of, cloud provider accounts to postdocs, graduate student researchers (GSRs), or others.
* Allow instructors to conveniently manage, and delegate the management of, cloud provider accounts to graduate student instructors (GSIs) or others.
* Help PIs and instructors to control and gain clearer insights into cloud costs via billing alerts, mechanisms to limit unintended overages, and best practices documentation.
