### Cloud Computing Support

The Berkeley Research Computing (BRC) Cloud Computing Support program offers consulting assistance, documentation, and tools to help faculty and other campus researchers obtain access to and effectively use cloud computing resources.

(Cloud computing is the use of computational resources, storage, and applications from commercial cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform, and from national computational centers like NERSC and XSEDE.)

BRC Cloud Computing Support can help you:

* Determine if the cloud is a good fit for your computational requirements.
* Plan for and manage costs of cloud computing.
* Gain access to cloud computing resources, both for research and research-related instruction.

*(Note that these three bullet points, while aligned with the VCRO letter, aren't a 1:1 match for the three categories in the one-pager, so we may want to think about whether some convergence here might be useful ...)*
