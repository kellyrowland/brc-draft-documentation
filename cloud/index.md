## Cloud Computing Support

The Berkeley Research Computing (BRC) Cloud Computing Support program offers consulting assistance, documentation, and tools to help faculty and other campus researchers obtain access to and effectively use cloud computing resources.

BRC Cloud Computing Support can help you:

* Determine if the cloud is a good fit for your computational requirements.
* Plan for and manage costs of cloud computing.
* Gain access to cloud computing resources, both for research and research-related instruction.

### Get started!

We welcome Berkeley faculty, staff, postdocs, and grad students at all levels of expertise to schedule time with our consultants, even at the very earliest stages of your research, for any size computational requirements you may have. Our standard consulting services are free of charge.

Please email us at the following address, and include the following in your request: a brief description of your project, a concise overview of the software and data you're using, and a summary of what stage you are at in your research process.
