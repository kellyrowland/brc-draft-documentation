# Getting Started

## Match Requirements to Resources

When your computational needs extend beyond the capabilities of your laptop, and even beyond those of any servers or clusters available in your research group or departmental unit, you have a number of options.

Berkeley Research Computing (BRC)'s Cloud Computing support can discuss your requirements with you and help you identify which option(s) might be a best fit for your requirements. These options include:

* UC Berkeley's own Savio computing cluster.

* Commercial cloud providers:
  * Amazon Web Services
  * Google Cloud Platform
  * Microsoft Azure
  * And others ...
  
* National computing infrastructure centers:
  * XSEDE
  * NERSC
  * And others ...
