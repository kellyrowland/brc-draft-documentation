## About the Cloud Consulting services

Berkeley Research Computing (BRC) Cloud Consulting services identify cloud resources that are well-matched to the needs of UC Berkeley researchers, and facilitate access to those resources.

Cloud resources may be provided by external vendors (such as [Amazon](http://aws.amazon.com/), [Google](https://cloud.google.com/), or [Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)), national centers (such as [XSEDE](https://www.xsede.org/) or [NERSC](https://www.nersc.gov/)), or by BRC itself. There is no cost to researchers for these consulting services, within manageable limits.

Here's what you can expect from the BRC Cloud consultants:

#### Engage with researchers to match requirements with appropriate cloud resources

* Review computing and data requirements for research uses to identify where those uses translate well to cloud resources.
* Assist researchers in identifying the set of cloud services that efficiently and effectively address their computational and storage requirements.
* Simplify the use of commonly used software stacks across multiple cloud platforms.
* Provide documentation, training, guidance, and referrals for translating commonly-encountered computing requirements into patterns suited for efficient and cost-effective use of cloud resources for instruction and research.
* Help researchers working with sensitive data identify whether and how they can appropriately work with that data on cloud resources.

#### Facilitate access to cloud resources

* Assist researchers in obtaining provider grants.
* Provide support for incorporating cloud computing resource costs into funding proposals.
* Publish documentation and provide consulting to help researchers benefit from campus contracts and guidelines.
* Assist researchers to manage costs and/or transfer times for moving data to and from cloud resources.

#### Automate cloud provisioning

* Provide automated provisioning scripts, ‘best practices’ examples, documentation, and consulting to support integrations with cloud providers that address specific types of campus research and instruction.
* Allow PIs to conveniently manage, and delegate the management of, cloud provider accounts to postdocs, graduate student researchers (GSRs), or others.
* Allow instructors to conveniently manage, and delegate the management of, cloud provider accounts to graduate student instructors (GSIs) or others.
* Help PIs and instructors to control and gain clearer insights into cloud costs via billing alerts, mechanisms to limit unintended overages, and best practices documentation.
