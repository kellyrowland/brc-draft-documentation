## Frequently Anticipated Questions

* **When will cloud computing support become available?**
  Cloud computing support is available today. The service which provides this support is
  scheduled to be formally announced to the UC Berkeley campus in August 2015.

* **What types of help can I get?**
  See the [Overview](/services/cloud-computing-support/overview-cloud-computing-support) for a detailed list
  of the types of help available.

* **Who is eligible for cloud computing support?**
  UC Berkeley faculty and other campus-affiliated researchers (e.g. research associates, adjuncts,
  postdocs, grad students, and research staff).

* **What does cloud computing support cost?**
  Consulting is free of charge. (Availability of no-cost consulting time may be limited.)
  
* **What cloud platform(s) should I use?**
  Cloud Computing Support consultants can help you determine if cloud computing is suited to your research computing
  requirements, as well as introduce you to the available options and assist in selecting a cloud platform(s).
  (Self-paced documentation for this and other common questions is planned to be added to this website over time.)

* **Can I pay for cloud computing by charging a UC Berkeley campus account?**
  When setting up payment for Amazon Web Services, you can specify that a campus account should be invoiced.
  This process is evolving; please contact a Cloud Computing Support consultant for assistance with this.
  We are working with campus partners to make it possible to use campus accounts with Microsoft Azure
  and Google Cloud Platform, as well.

* **How should I describe BRC's Cloud Computing support in a grant proposal, or in faculty recruitment or retention letters?**
  You can use this language: "UC Berkeley's Research IT consultants will advise on and support (faculty member)
  and their research team in identifying computational services appropriate to their research from one or more
  cloud service providers. They will also offer support in procuring and using cloud services, to the extent
  described at http://research-it.berkeley.edu/services/cloud-computing-support/overview-cloud-computing-support"
